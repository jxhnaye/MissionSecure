# About The Website
This website was developed using Vite and React by the LA Tech.org intern group under the name "Mission Secure". The goal of this project is to provide an accessible and interactive platform that helps users assess and improve their cybersecurity hygiene. The site features a self-assessment quiz that gives immediate, personalized feedback upon completion, helping users understand their strengths and areas for improvement in cybersecurity practices.

In addition to the quiz, the platform includes an updating bulletin board that highlights current events and developments in the cybersecurity world, a grading and response system that adapts to usersâ€™ scores, and a fully integrated database designed to collect and organize user inputs, questions, and feedback. Together, these elements create a dynamic learning experience centered on security awareness and digital safety.

# Technical Overview
The site was scaffolded with Vite and built using React, which provides a fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and efficient ESLint integration.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
