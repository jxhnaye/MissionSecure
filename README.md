# About The Website

This website was scaffolded by vite and react by the LA Tech.org group that goes by "Mission Secure"
We aim to create a easy to access secure website where the user can quiz themselves on a well researched test about cybersecurity hygine we have tailored that gives the user feedback after they finish the test. We have successfully added and intergrated an updating bulletin board of things going on in the cybersecurity world, a grading system that gives you many responses based on your score, and a fully integrated database that helps collect user inputs that have to do with questions & concerns. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
